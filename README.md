# Sentiment Analyzer Project

## Overview:

This project focuses on sentiment analysis using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and classify the sentiment expressed in textual data. The project covers a variety of tasks, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to sentiment labeling and comparison between different sentiment analysis tools.

## Key Components:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Data loading, examination, and visualization.
   - Handling missing values.

2. **Sentiment Labeling:**
   - Utilizes VADER and TextBlob for sentiment analysis.
   - Assigns sentiment labels based on predefined thresholds.

3. **Sentiment Comparison:**
   - Compares results from VADER and TextBlob sentiment analysis.
   - Explores differences in sentiment interpretations.

4. **Visualizations:**
   - Word clouds, bar charts, and pair plots.
   - Represents sentiment distributions and insights.

## Project Structure:

Organized into distinct sections, each addressing a specific aspect of sentiment analysis.

## Usage:

1. Load your dataset.
2. Follow code snippets for EDA, sentiment labeling, and visualizations.
3. Ensure required libraries (NLTK, Seaborn, etc.) are installed.

Feel free to customize the code based on your specific dataset and analysis requirements.
